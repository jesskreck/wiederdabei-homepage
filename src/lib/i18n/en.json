          "answer": "Our services are aimed at anyone looking to re-enter the workforce after a longer break (more than two years) or seeking a new professional opportunity despite rejection and challenges. Whether after parental leave, illness, unemployment, or career reorientation – we help you get back on your feet."
        },

          "question": "Do I need to write a job application?",
          "answer": "No. Really not. No resume, no cover letter. We talk with you, you tell us what you can do – and we take care of the rest."

          "question": "I can't imagine having a regular job anymore.",
          "answer": "We understand. Many here have been through it all – measures, applications, rejections. The difference: With us, there are jobs because we ensure the funding is there beforehand. And: You're needed, not just managed. If you want, we can find out together what's possible."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does your support cost?",
          "answer": "Nothing. Placement is free for you. The job center covers your salary – your employer pays only a portion or even nothing. For you, this means: You get a real job with salary, social insurance, pension insurance – and even coaching, because we know how difficult it is to re-enter after so many years."
        },
        {
          "question": "In which industries can you place people?",
          "answer": "Through our special partnerships with 'returner-friendly' employers, opportunities open up in areas that would otherwise be difficult to access. By the way: If you haven't worked (or worked very little) for 6 or more years, the job center pays your new employer your entire salary for two years - with that argument, we can convince any employer about you! We take care of that for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does it take to find a job?",
          "answer": "It varies. Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it takes a bit longer. But we stay on it. And you don't have to be ready at the push of a button – you set the pace. We meet you where you are right now."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I haven't worked for a long time?",
          "answer": "Then you're exactly the person this new system was made for. No matter how long – 2 years, 6 years, 15 years – if you want to work, we'll make sure it's possible again."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I don't know yet if working again is possible for me?",
          "answer": "Then we'll find out together. First, let's have a conversation. You don't have to commit to anything. There's also the possibility of easing back in through an internship – or simply saying: I want to check it out first."
